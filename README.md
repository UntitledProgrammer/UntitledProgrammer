# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Tom Jacobs, a programmer and MSc Advanced Computing student at the University of Suffolk (UoS).
I have a background in computer game programming, with a particular interest in engine and graphics programming; however, I have since diversified into a range of broader software development environments.
I typically work with various front-end and back-end languages, from dynamic languages such as Python to static languages such as C. That said, with my background, I still frequently work with C/C++ and occasionally Rust or C#.
